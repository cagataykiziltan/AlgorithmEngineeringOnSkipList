Some optimizations to make faster standart skip list which is advanced data structure.

Includes that 

1. Parameter changing to measure and understand dynamics of skip list.
2. Reducing comparison cost and go down two by two instead of one.
3. Starting from middle point on doubly skip list.
4. Cache sensitive skip list with binary search support.
